html canvas notes

SETTING UP CANVAS____________________________________
1. get the canvas variable with
	var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
2. set canvas width/height with
	canvas.width = 100;
	canvas.height = window.innerHeight
	this can also be done with
	canvas.style.width  = '800px';
3. get the context variable
	var c = canvas.getContext('2d');
	we use c to draw everything, idk what it is but
	it contains a shit ton of methods 
DRAWING_______________________________________________
1.draw line:
	in order to draw a line we first need to define a path
	which the line will follow.
	c.beginPath() needs to be called first
	c.moveTo(x,y) this moves the "cursor" of the line
		without drawing anything
	c.lineTo(x,y) this draws a line from the current
		position of the paths end to the x,y
	
	then once you are done defining the path you need
	to draw the line
	c.strokeStyle = "red"; any css value for color works here
	c.lineWidth = 2;
	c.stoke() draws the line.
2. draw rectange
	
	
	c.beginPath(); since stroking a rect is a path then we  need to start a new one 
		otherwise a line will be drawn from our previous path
	c.fillStyle = 'rgba(255,0,0,0.5)'; color is transparent red
	c.rect(x,y,w,h); draws a rect path
	c.fill(); fills in the path
	c.stroke(); adds outline

3. draw circle/ arc
	c.beginPath()
	c.fillStyle = "red";
	c.arc(x,y,radius, starting angle (0 for circle),
		end angle(2*pi for circle), drawClockwiseboolean)
	c.fill();  this fills in the path which is drawn, fillRect has this incorportated 
		for some reason but there is no equivilent for the circle
	c.stroke();


4. animate shit
	function animate(){
		requestAnimationFrame(animate); //this waits until the computer is ready to update (usually 60 fps)
		c.clearRect(0,0,canvas.width, canvas.height); //this clears the entire screen
		//put shit here
		//fuckin easy
	}
	animate();
