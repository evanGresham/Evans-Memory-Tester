website plan:


- have a calender with days colored in 
green which we did a test and red if
we missed.

- multiple categories, inc: actors, 
comedians, cars, dog breeds etc.


- also a misc category which mixes
all  the other categories

- each test is like 20-30 questions



Question types:
- picture, e.g whats this actor
	- i also want some info to be
	able to be added. e.g when you 
	guess robert downey jr, before
	the next pic, some info about
	him pops up for a couple of 
	seconds, like movies dob and
	shit
- text, e.g. word defintions, "whats
	the capital of egypt"

- a close enough button might be a 
good idea for when you get it right but
spell something wrong. maybe but maybe not

- also an honesty system, which will
be like it asks the question. then
i answer in my head then click answer
and if i got it wrong i will say so.
its just if i cant be fucked typing.
might be good for phone version
